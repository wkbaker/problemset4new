In this projet we created a java based code that creates a version of the game of Flappy Bird and allows the user to click using the mouse or spacebar to move the bird in between the columns. 

In the creation of this project we implemented three interfaces: ActionListener, MouseListener, and KeyListener
We created two java classes; public FlappyBird() and public class Renderer extends Jpanel()

The purpose of this code was to create a window that pops up on the screen when the program is run that has various graphics of different colors that generates the game Flappy Bird. 
The program allows the user to click on the mousepad or spacebar to change the position of the bird in order to navigate the bird between the different columns.
The program keeps track of the amount of times the user sucessfully passes through a column/obstacle.
The program prints the message, "Game Over!" to the screen and ends the game when the bird hits one of the obstacles. The user then has the option to click on the screen again to restart the game.

The program is able to run through the creation of various methods such as:
- addColumn()
- paintColumn()
- jump()


Decisions during implementation of code:

public FlappyBird()
-This is a constructor that initializes objects such as JFrame, Timer, and Rendered, essentially preparing for the game to start. 

public void addColumn(boolean start) 
-When the boolean is true and the game has started, the method sets up the first pair of columns off the screen a specific distance a part from one another and then the columns appear on screen for the game to begin
-When the boolean is false and the game has not just started, new pairs of columns are added to the game window


public void jump()
-This method handles the motion of the bird and the mechanics of when the game has started and ended
-The first for loop allows columns to move across the screen at a certain speed
-The next for loop checks to see if columns have moved off the screen and if so, removes these columns from the list
-The if column(intersects(bird)) statement detects if the bird has collided into a column and if so, adjusts the gameOver condition to true

renderer.repaint() 
-This method is called when the game starts, ends, and is being played in order to display graphics, displauy text on the screen when the game begins and ends, etc.
